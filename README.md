This repository serves as a placeholder for the sciwork conference portal.
The primary content for each yearâ€™s conference is now hosted in dedicated
repositories, following the swconf[year] naming convention (e.g. swconf2024).

If a new conference site is created, update the `netlify.toml` file in this
repository to reflect the necessary changes.
