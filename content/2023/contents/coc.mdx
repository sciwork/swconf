# Code of conduct

The on-site and online activities of sciwork provide a harassment-free experience. Everyone should use inclusive attitude and expression to each other. We believe friendliness, inclusion, and diversity are critical to the community. We do not tolerate harassment toward participants in any form. Appropriate actions will be taken to handle behaviors violating the code of conduct.

The current version of the code of conduct is kept short to invite discussions and improvements from the community. The code of conduct should be a consensus among the community and developed by the community.

The reports of violation of the sciwork code of conduct should be sent to the email address [integrity@sciwork.dev](mailto:integrity@sciwork.dev), which is only accessible by the sciwork code-of-conduct enforcement team. All reports will be confidential. The enforcement team will review the violation reports. For violations that require immediate reaction, the team will perform preliminary review in 24 hours. For other violations or non-violation reports, the team will perform preliminary review in 72 hours. The violation should be handled in confidential ways, unless it is proper to reveal some of the process or result.
