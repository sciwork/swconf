# Financial Aid
Our financial assistance program operates on a review basis, so please feel free to reach out if you are in need. After receiving all applications, we will make decisions based on factors such as the budget and the applicants' situations to determine whether assistance and to what extent it will be provided. Due to limited conference funds, the number of recipients will be limited. In this situation, we aim to prioritize those who are in the greatest need or can make the most significant contribution to the event. For example, students with lower family incomes will be given priority over engineers with stable employment.

## Eligibility
Anyone in need is welcome to apply, and we strive to assist as many people as possible in participating in the conference.

## Auxiliary Items
Sciwork 2023 Conference tickets and transportation subsidies (the amount is determined based on the review results).
